# Forensics-Reverse-Pentesting-VM's  

1. One of the main aims of this repository is to provide a forensics lab, enabling machines to be made available fairly quickly in order to carry out digital forensics in the most secure way possible (modestly up to the level of virtual machines).  
[Forensics-Reverse-Project](./Forensics-Reverse-VM)

2. The second objective is to create a Kali machine with the ability to configure the packages to be installed at build time, the aim being to be able to build a Kali-linux machine as quickly as possible (up to level of vagrant).
