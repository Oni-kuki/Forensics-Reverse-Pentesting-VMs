# Vagrant Pentest-VM's
 
> [!CAUTION]
> For construction in the vagrantfile, you have 2 choices: either you use the shell in the vagrantfile as a provisioner, or the install.sh file I've made available (in which you can find osint tools, by the way :wink: ).
the important point is that in your vagrantfile you must comment out the methodology you don't want.   

> By default the VM configuration:  
> vb.memory = "4096"  
> vb.cpus = "2"  

You'll be able to use the machine after it's rebooted
### Prerequisites  
1. Installation of Vagrant and git  
arch
```

```  
Debian / ubuntu

apt install vagrant git -y
```  
Windows

winget install vagrant
```  
or

2. Cloning this repository or downloading it  
```
git clone https://github.com/Oni-kuki/Forensics-Reverse-Pentesting-VMs/
```
### Modifying configuration  
1. Modify the vagrantfile with the specific configuration (if you want)  
Normally the machine's base iso is always the latest version, but not all packages are always up to date. If you want to update all the packages when you build your machine, add the following line in vagrantfile  
```bash
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-EOF
    sudo su
    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
    apt-get update -y

    apt upgrade -y
    
    timedatectl set-timezone "Europe/Paris"
    sed -i 's/XKBLAYOUT="us"/XKBLAYOUT="fr"/' /etc/default/keyboard
    reboot
  EOF
```  
## Starting  
1. Construct the VM  
```
vagrant up
```
